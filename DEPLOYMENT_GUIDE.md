## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For Cart & Orders to Work:
- **localStorage works on all hosting** - Orders will be saved in each user's browser
- **Admin page works** - Owner can access from any device
- **No backend needed** - Everything works client-side

### Limitations:
- Orders are stored in browser (not a database)
- If user clears browser data, orders are lost
- Each device has separate order storage
- For production, you'd want a backend (but this works for now!)

### Updating the Website:
- **Netlify/Vercel:** Just drag and drop the folder again (replaces old version)
- **GitHub Pages:** Upload new files, they update automatically
